# GitHub API project using React

This is a basic react project that generates a dashboard for comparison between different JavaScript Frameworks, namely React, Angular, Ember and Vue. The purpose is to get the count of starts, watchers and followers for these repositories with auto refresh as votes in order to track the activity on them. This can be expanded to include Commits, Pull requests, Issues, etc.
